Generation happens by placing pre-made rooms made up of multiples of 7*7 tiles, where 7*7 tiles is 1 dungeon grid cell.

All rooms will hang of the player spawn room which will be at cell position 0/0.

Each room will be represented by an array of 7*7 dungeon grid cells, where each cell has:
    - Whether the cell is the entrance cell (links up to an existing room)
    - If the entrance cell, the direction at which it attaches to an existing room.
    - If the entrance cell, the type of door that is generated at which it attaches to an existing room.
    - A x/y dungeon grid cell positions relative to the entrance cell where the entrance cell has a dungeon cell position of 0/0.
    - relative x/y positioned contents.
    - The type of door that is made between it and the existing dungeon grid cell that it attaches to.

Rooms have an optional range, which defines the range at which it can be generated, based on its entracne cell position.

Rooms will have am optional spawn chance, which will be evaluated once per generation.

Example:

{
    name: "empty_3*1_room",
    cells: {
        {
            position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
            entrance: Direction.EAST,
            door: Door.THREE_KEYS,
            contents: []
        },
        {
            position: { x: -1, y: 0 },
            contents: []
        },
        {
            position: { x: -2, y: 0 },
            blocked: [
                Direction.EAST
            ],
            contents: []
        }
    }
}

ENTITY GENERATION

The entties array contains a nested structure of objects which expose either:
- ID if the object represents an entity to generate.
- PARTICIPANTS with an array of other objects which MUST have a ticket count each.
- ENTITIES Multiple objects of any of these three types.

Example: A 1 in 4 chance to generate a ultra rare chest at 2/2.
entities: [
    {
        participants: [
            {
                tickets: 1,
                x: 2,
                y: 2,
                id: "ultra_rare_chest", 
                direction: DIRECTION.EAST 
            },
            {
                tickets: 3,
                x: 2,
                y: 2,
                id: "rare_chest", 
                direction: DIRECTION.EAST 
            }
        ]
    }
]

Example: 
    A 1 in 4 chance to get a 'pot' as 2/2.
    OR
    A 3 in 4 chance to get:
        A 1 in 2 chance to get a box at 4/4
        OR
        A 1 in 2 chance to get:
            A box at 3/3
            AND
            A 1 in 4 chance to get:
                nothing
                OR
                A 3 in 4 chance to get a pickle at 2/2

entities: [
    {
        participants: [
            { 
                tickets: 1,
                x: 2,
                y: 2,
                id: "pot", 
                direction: DIRECTION.EAST 
            },
            { 
                tickets: 3, 
                participants: [
                    { 
                        tickets: 1,
                        x: 4,
                        y: 4,
                        id: "box", 
                        direction: DIRECTION.EAST 
                    },
                    { 
                        tickets: 1, 
                        entities: [
                            {

                                id: "box",

                            { 
                                participants: [
                                    {
                                        tickets: 1

                                        tickets: 3,
                                        x: 2,
                                        y: 2,
                                        id: "pickle", 
                                        direction: DIRECTION.EAST 
                                    }
                                ]
                            }
                        ]

TERMINOLOGY

CELL
A cell is tile-based position in a dungeon that can be empty or be made up of a square collection of tiles that represent all or part of a room.

ANCHOR
An empty cell at which an entrance cell of a room can be placed, it also defines in which direction this link happens.

CONTENTS
Each cell will define its contents. This is a relative x/y tile positioned entity with either:
     - An id (required), 
     - A facing direction (optional, random if not defined)
     - A spawn chance (optional)

     OR

     An array of participants from which one will be randomly picked based on a lotto, each with:
     - An id (optional, if not provided then if this is the winner then nothing will be generated), 
     - A facing direction (optional, random if not defined)
     - The number of tickets held (required)
