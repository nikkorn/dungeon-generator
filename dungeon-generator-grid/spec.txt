Generation happens by placing pre-made rooms made up of multiples of 7*7 tiles, where 7*7 tiles is 1 dungeon grid cell.

All rooms will hang of the player spawn room which will be at cell position 0/0.

Each room will be represented by an array of 7*7 dungeon grid cells, where each cell has:
    - Whether the cell is the entrance cell (links up to an existing room)
    - If the entrance cell, the direction at which it attaches to an existing room.
    - If the entrance cell, the type of door that is generated at which it attaches to an existing room.
    - A x/y dungeon grid cell positions relative to the entrance cell where the entrance cell has a dungeon cell position of 0/0.
    - relative x/y positioned contents.
    - The type of door that is made between it and the existing dungeon grid cell that it attaches to.

Example:

{
    name: "empty_3*1_room",
    cells: {
        {
            position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
            entrance: Direction.EAST,
            door: Door.THREE_KEYS,
            contents: []
        },
        {
            position: { x: -1, y: 0 },
            contents: []
        },
        {
            position: { x: -2, y: 0 },
            blocked: [
                Direction.EAST
            ],
            contents: []
        }
    }
}
