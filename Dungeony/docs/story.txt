Set in in a medieval fantasy world of magic. The game takes place in a huge forest where goblins used to live, these goblins were much more technically advanced than the rest of the world and were very reclusive.
They mined for treasures while building crazy machines to protect their forest and their valuables. Thousands of years later and the goblins have all died out, and hoardes of treasure hunters have stared to make
their way into the forest to claim the treasures left, as well as the technology.

Our treasure hunters must avoid traps and robots left by the goblins to guard their home while moving through the forest to claim the ultimate prize, a magical gem that the goblins had found deep under the forest
that was used as an infinite power source to power all of their machinery.
