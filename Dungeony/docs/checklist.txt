Things to do!

NPC/Enemy
- Add ability to define a behaviour script for an enemy/npc.

Collision
- Refine the collision handling to take care of intermediate steps for long updates.

Level
- Maybe add tile behaviour scripts? To handle things like a trap door being walked over, or a door tile being interacted with to walk through.
- Level objects could have optional scripts too i guess to allow for special behaviour.
- Fix stupid delta use in level grid, totes not using it right.
