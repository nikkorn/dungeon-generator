Things to do!

NPC/Enemy
- Add ability to define a behaviour script for an enemy/npc.

Collision
- Refine the collision handling to take care of intermediate steps for long updates.

Level
- Maybe add tile behaviour scripts? To handle things like a trap door being walked over, or a door tile being interacted with to walk through.
- Level objects could have optional scripts too i guess to allow for special behaviour.
- Fix stupid delta use in level grid, totes not using it right.


First Pass
==========

Aim for single-player first.

Only use a set number of standard level categories, with a single spawn and single locked exit door that is opened by a single key held by one enemy.

Enemy behaviour is limited to waiting for players to come within a range and then follow/attack based on weapon range and RNG.
On killing an enemy, the enemy will drop a number of items.

The only items to be added will be the pistol weapon, pistol ammo and the level exit key.
