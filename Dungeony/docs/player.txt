Players will have a backpack sprite drawn just behind them which grows in size based on how heavy the items in their inventory are.

Players have:
 - Gold amount.
 - HP points (8 by default?)
 - MP points which allow the player to use magical weapons.
 - Equipment load, The more stuff the player is carrying in their inventory the slower they move and can effect roll ability.
 - Active status effects. E.g. health increase over time after taking bitter pellet.
 - Gem slots
