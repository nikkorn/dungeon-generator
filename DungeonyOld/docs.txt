GAMEPLAY
Single or online multiplayer rougelike where you descend through generated levels in a dungeon to see how far you get.

Floors cannot be revisited.

Different types of keys are collected throughout, which can be used for different types of doors.
These keys are carried throught the game and do not disappear between levels.

For example:
	- Basic keys are the most common and can be used to open most types of door, but some doors will require multiple basic keys.
	   - Doors hiding rooms where there will be enemies and chances of lower level loot take 1 key.
		 - Doors hiding rooms where there will be no enemies and chances of lower level loot take 2 keys.
		 - Doors hiding rooms where there will be stronger enemies and chances of higher level loot take 3 keys.
		 - Doors hiding rooms where there will be no enemies and chances of higher level loot take 4 keys.
		 - Doors hiding rooms where there will be no enemies guaranteed good loot will take 5 keys.
	- Shop keys are rarer and can be used to open shop doors. If the team has a lot of equipment then these should be saved until later levels.
	- Level keys are one-per-level and will open doors to the room leading to the next floor down, these will be dropped in rooms with the levels strongest enemies or can be bought for a lot of gold.

	Doors that take multiple keys can have keys placed in them one at a time, even by different players. Keys can NEVER be removed from doors.
